## Udacity Deep Learning Foundations image classification project 

Implemented a simple convolutional neural network for image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset in TensorFlow. Key elements include 
 * Multiple stacks of convolutional and max-pooling layers with relu activation function
 * Multiple stacks of full connected layers
 * Dropout in the layers mentioned above
 * A single output layers for logits and softmax 
 * Cross entropy loss
 * Initilization for weights and biases using trucated normal with standard deviation = 0.5
